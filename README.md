- Reach the exit point to complete each level and progress to the next one.
- The game features multiple levels of increasing difficulty, providing a challenging experience for players.

## 4. Libraries Used and Installation Command
### Libraries Used
The platformer game utilizes several Python libraries to provide its functionality:

- **Pygame**: A set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries.
- **Pickle**: A module used for serializing and deserializing Python objects. It allows objects to be saved to and restored from files.
- **OS Module**: A module in Python that provides functions for interacting with the operating system. It is used here for file path manipulation.
- **Sys Module**: A module in Python that provides access to some variables used or maintained by the Python interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter. It is used here for system-specific parameters and functions.

### Installation Command
To install the required libraries for running the platformer game, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

This command will install the Pygame library, which is the main dependency for running the game. Make sure to run this command in your terminal or command prompt with Python and pip installed. Additionally, the other libraries used (Pickle, OS, and Sys) are built-in Python modules and do not require separate installation.

## 5. Conclusion
The platformer game offers an entertaining and engaging experience for players of all ages. With its diverse range of obstacles, enemies, and challenges, players can enjoy hours of fun as they navigate through each level. Whether you're a casual gamer looking for some entertainment or a platformer enthusiast seeking a new adventure, this game has something for everyone.
